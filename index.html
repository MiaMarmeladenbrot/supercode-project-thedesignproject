            <p>
              Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
              could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I
              wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had
              only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for
              some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I
              thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a
              daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was
              that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
              problem.

              <h4>Start with asking why</h4>
              <p>
                You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more
                effective ways of achieving goals.

              <p>
                By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas
                will be fresher and more valuable.

              <h4>Design solutions with love</h4>
              <p>
                Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand
                the frustration of the users and resolve to end it.

              <p>
                As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that‚Äôs not
                finished or doesn‚Äôt look perfect. You will learn to accept
                feedback and learn from it.
